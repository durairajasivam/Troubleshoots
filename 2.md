You can inspect push events and their impact on the pipeline by checking several areas in Azure DevOps and, if applicable, your version control system (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket). Here are some ways to check if push events are being registered correctly:

### 1. Azure DevOps Activity Tab

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps portal and go to `Pipelines`.
2. Select the pipeline you are investigating.
3. Click on the `Activity` tab.
  
This tab shows a list of runs for your pipeline, including the triggers for those runs. Check to see if push events are appearing as expected.

### 2. Azure DevOps Logs

1. Again, go to `Pipelines` in your Azure DevOps portal.
2. Click on a specific run of the pipeline in question.
3. View the `Logs` tab.

These logs include details about the trigger event and can show errors that may have prevented a run.

### 3. Repository Webhooks

If you're using an external repository like GitHub or Bitbucket, you can check the webhooks logs to see if the events are being sent to Azure DevOps.

For GitHub:

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on `Settings` > `Webhooks`.
3. Click on the webhook for your Azure DevOps instance.
4. You will see a list of `Recent Deliveries`. Check if push events are listed and what their response status is.

For Azure Repos:

1. Go to your Azure DevOps portal.
2. Navigate to `Repos`.
3. Click on the repository and go to `Settings`.
4. Go to the `Hooks` or `Service Hooks` section to check the logs for push events.

### 4. Diagnostic Settings in Azure DevOps

You can enable additional diagnostics for your pipeline to capture more details:

1. Navigate to `Project settings` at the bottom of the Azure DevOps portal.
2. Go to `Pipelines` > `Settings`.
3. Enable additional diagnostic settings if available.

### 5. Check Network/Firewall Logs

If you're using Azure DevOps Server (on-premises), network or firewall issues could block push events. Check the logs to ensure network traffic is being allowed.

By examining these areas, you should get a good idea of whether push events are being registered and handled correctly, or if there is an issue that needs further investigation.
