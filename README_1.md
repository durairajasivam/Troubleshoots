Certainly, here's how you can check each of these factors:

### Check the YAML Configuration

1. Open your Azure DevOps project.
2. Navigate to the `Pipelines` section.
3. Select your pipeline and click `Edit` to view the YAML file.
4. Review the `trigger` section to make sure it's configured as you expect. For example:
   ```yaml
   trigger:
     branches:
       include:
       - main
       - feature/*
   ```

### Branch Filters

1. In the same YAML file, look at the `trigger` section to see which branches are configured.
2. Make sure the branch you are pushing to is included in the list.

### Path Filters

1. In the YAML file, the `trigger` section can also include `paths`. Check if this is configured correctly:
   ```yaml
   trigger:
     paths:
       include:
       - folder1/*
       exclude:
       - folder2/*
   ```

### Check User Permissions

1. Navigate to `Project settings`.
2. Under `Permissions`, make sure the user or group associated with the build has the necessary permissions.

### Webhooks

1. If you're using GitHub, go to the repository settings and check the `Webhooks` section to see if Azure DevOps is listed and active.
2. If Azure DevOps, go to `Project settings` > `Service hooks` to see if the webhook is correctly configured.

### Firewall or Network Issues

1. For Azure DevOps Server on-premises, check your network firewall and ensure that it is not blocking outgoing or incoming webhooks.

### Service Hooks

1. In Azure DevOps, go to `Project settings`.
2. Navigate to `Service hooks` to see if any are configured that might interfere with the build trigger.

### Manual Triggers

1. Go to `Pipelines`.
2. Click on `Run pipeline`.
3. Follow the prompts to manually initiate a build to see if the pipeline itself has issues.

### Error Messages/Logs

1. Go to `Pipelines` and click on the pipeline that is not triggering.
2. If there was a failed run, click on it.
3. Review the logs for errors or warnings.

### Check Activity

1. Go to `Pipelines`.
2. Click on your pipeline.
3. You will see an `Activity` tab that lists the history of runs for the pipeline. You can click on each to see why it was triggered or not.

By systematically going through these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of why your Azure DevOps pipeline is not triggering.
